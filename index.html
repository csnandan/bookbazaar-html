          Moby-Dick; or, The Whale is an 1851 epic novel by American writer
          Herman Melville. The book is centered on the sailor Ishmael's
          narrative of the maniacal quest of Ahab, captain of the whaling ship
          Pequod, for vengeance against Moby Dick, the giant white sperm whale
          that bit off his leg on the ship's previous voyage. A contribution to
          the literature of the American Renaissance, Moby-Dick was published to
          mixed reviews, was a commercial failure, and was out of print at the
          time of the author's death in 1891. Its reputation as a Great American
          Novel was established only in the 20th century, after the 1919
          centennial of its author's birth. William Faulkner said he wished he
          had written the book himself, and D. H. Lawrence called it "one of the
          strangest and most wonderful books in the world" and "the greatest
          book of the sea ever written". Its opening sentence, "Call me
          Ishmael", is among world literature's most famous.

          To Kill a Mockingbird is a 1960 Southern Gothic novel by American
          author Harper Lee. It became instantly successful after its release;
          in the United States, it is widely read in high schools and middle
          schools. To Kill a Mockingbird won the Pulitzer Prize a year after its
          release, and it has become a classic of modern American literature.
          The plot and characters are loosely based on Lee's observations of her
          family, her neighbors and an event that occurred near her hometown of
          Monroeville, Alabama, in 1936, when she was ten.
